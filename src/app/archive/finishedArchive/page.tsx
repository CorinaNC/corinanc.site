      Well, I've finally gotten the archive section up and running!  Obligatory rename because "writings" sounded a little too vague for what I wanted this section to be. I'll try to update this page whenever I want to put my interests or thoughts somewhere, whether they be related to CS or not.  Recently, I've been using video games as a way to destress from the rigor of both school and the job search.  One of the games that's caught my attention recently is Mario Maker 2.  I've owned Mario Maker since about freshman year of high school but I got back into it because I finished Hollow Knight (which if you haven't played you really should, 10/10 game) and wanted another game to scratch the platformer itch.  There's this community of players in the Mario community who like super super super hard levels that are called Kaizo Levels.  Generally, they use the Super Mario World engine but with the release of Mario Maker there was an uptick in levels that used the SMB1, SMB3, NSMB, and SM3DW engines. Anyways, I don't want to get too off-track - the point is I've found Mario Maker to be a great distraction as I've been playing Kaizo levels and have been quite impressed with the creativity of the community.  At some point, I want to work on a platformer and a lot of the levels that I've been playing utilize the Mario engines in creative and unique ways.  Furthermore, Nintendo's most recent 2D Mario iteration, Super Mario Wonder, shares resemblance to some of the more popular Mario Maker levels which I thought was super cool! Unfortunately, the embedded video I've posted does not classify as a Kaizo level but is rather a speedrun level where the user has to beat it in 20 seconds; my Nintendo Switch can only record 30 seconds at a time and I don't own a capture card :(. Hopefully I'll be able to replace the video with a better example in the future but we'll see!  Regardless, I just needed something to talk about as my first blog post on here, so apologies if it seems rather bare-bones.  But regardless, I'm glad I finally got around to finishing this section as it officially means that my website is complete! So yippee! :D
