      Well it's come to that point in the semester.  That point being the end of it.  The image above is of me winning a record player at student bingo this year. (It wasn't that good unfortunately, but it's cool I won it!) It feels weird to be writing this because technically I only have three semesters left of being at the U of M.  I've had a few conversations with my friends about how fast paced everything feels in comparison to high school and I'm starting to understand what old teachers I had would say: time flies by before you know it.  As I ruminate over the past semester, I look at all of the work I've done and I'm proud of what I've accomplished.  I think that I've learned a lot in the past year and if you had asked me a year ago that I'd be in the place I am I wouldn't have believed you.  Like most college students, I was stressed about finding an internship among feeling like an imposter among so many bright and passionate peers.  There's a certain urgency that comes with being a college student that is amplified by the saturation of the computer science major.  From my own experience, looking at advice online was more often than not overwhelming rather than helpful.  The weight of receiving an internship offer, the necessity of outside projects, and the gravity of college level coursework.  With all of these elements stacking upon my schedule, it felt as though being distressed was the natural state of things.  I hadn't even started applying to internships seriously until December of 2023, something that, at the time, discouraged me from believing I would land anything the coming summer.  But during the final week of winter break, I received an email to interview with my first company.  Unfortunately another candidate fit the role more but receiving my first interview gave me incentive to continue applying. And the next few months passed, more and more interviews came and went. However, my process was not without strife, as for every interview I got it seemed as though a rejection would follow shortly after.  My insecurities nearly cost me my final interview as I almost skipped it because I had no expectations for myself after the rejections I received.  But I pulled myself up and did the interview anyway.  It was for a company that I remember doing a virtual interview for, "Zurich Insurance". I met with the development lead and one of the software engineers and answered the questions the best that I could.  When I finished the interview, I was worried about how I came across, I was upfront about having minimal experience with their stack and some of the work they would be assigning to their internship pick.  And I hadn't expected anything to come of the interview.  That was until about a week later.  I was in the middle of my Machine Architecture lab, having my friend explain some of the concepts to me; I checked my email and saw that the recruiter had emailed me asking if I would be ready for a quick call. She stated she had good news to share. I didn't want to assume the best in the event of disappointment.  I took the call.  I was told that Zurich was interested in hiring me as an intern. I remember the day so vividly, being ecstatic that my internship search had come to a close, that I had been chosen in favor of numerous other students. I could barely believe it; I had an internship!  Over the course of the summer I worked as a software developer intern with Zurich's subsidary, RCIS. They had me work on their internet services team; I learned so much from the other engineers and received mentorship in an Angular + .NET C# tech stack.  I returned to my Junior year with invaluable knowledge about working as a developer and I'm so grateful for the opportunity.  The previous semester has felt less stressful compared to earlier in my collegial career. I've felt more confident in my own abilities and was even comfortable enough bringing three of my friends to their first Hackathon over in Madison, WI. I've realized that the more I learn about this field, the more I design, and the more I develop, the more I fall in love with computer science.  I've been wanting to do software development ever since I was a kid. But other hobbies and school took up most of my time when I was growing up and sometimes it seems every new concept I learn, two more grow in its place.  But now, I'm in a position where I feel comfortable taking initiative for myself and even bringing other people along for the journey too.  I truly mean it wholeheartedly when I say: I can't wait to see where I'll go next.
