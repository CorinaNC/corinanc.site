      I've decided that I'm probably going to attempt to create updates on this archive for my end of semester retrospectives.  Considering I only have one to two semesters left this should hopefully not muddy my page with too many articles.  Anyway, this year was incredibly competitive for internship positions.  More and more students are graduating with or in the middle of their computer science degree.  Knowing this, I started applying to other positions as early as possible.  I ended up receiving a return offer with Zurich Insurance which MASSIVELY helped me not overstress for the next school year.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting many callbacks since the industry is in a rut for headcount and hiring, but I ended up accepting my position with Zurich after a month post internship.  This was my first year doing OAs and admittedly I was not prepared for most of them.  However, when it came to non-automatic OAs two notable companies that contacted me were Google and GitHub.  I was able to do both of their OAs pretty easily because at that point (after my numerous failed attempts) I had more experience under my belt for Leetcode and DSA.  I wasn't expecting anything to come from either of these companies and Google denied me shortly after I passed their OA (rip).  But in early January I got contacted by GitHub to schedule an interview.  My initial reaction was "holy crap" and my reaction afterwards was also "holy crap".  The interview was just a screen with the recruiter and I was super super nervous going into it because GitHub is one of my dream companies.  Unfortunately, I got denied about a month later but the fact that I got noticed by them was enough of an accomplishment.  Outside of GitHub, since I had an offer lined up I wasn't really trying to apply to anything outside of roles that I was really really interested in.  Two of those roles were Workiva and Target's Software Engineer Internship program.  It's funny because someone I know was a part of Target's first batch of interviews when I had applied earlier than them, so I automatically thought they denied me.  Until I got the email that they were interested in interviewing me.  Their interview process was pretty straight forward and was just some simple debugging with some pseudo-code.  As for Workiva, my interview process was a little weird.  My first interview was with two former interns who were current software engineers at the company.  We went through a simple array DSA problem.  I took longer than what I would've liked on this problem but I ended up getting an optimal solution which passed the test cases.  I wasn't feeling super confident on the interview and about a week later my recruiter emailed me back saying they chose another candidate.  But... at the end of the email she told me that another team was interested in interviewing me which was INSANE! I obviously took this interview and hopped into a Google Meeting with a senior software engineer and the engineering manager.  The behavioral portion of this interview went well but I did terribly on the technical portion.  Instead of a Leetcode question, the question asked was a React question asking the candidate to program a simple app.  I hadn't looked at or programmed in React in a few months so I ended up having trouble coding a solution.  I tried to compensate by speaking in more high level terms and explaining how I would approach the problem in pseudocode, but by the end of the interview I was super embarrassed and assumed that I sabotaged my opportunity.  A few days later I ended up hearing back from Target and they were interested in hiring me.  I thought about it for a bit and decided that despite current events it'd be a good idea to work with them.  The recruiter had to go over the offer terms for the next day so I wasn't able to accept the offer yet.  But to my absolute SHOCK the next day I got an email from the Workiva recruiter asking to schedule a phone call.  I was at my school's public gym with this happened and my heart stopped in its tracks.  I didn't know if what I was thinking was true but I immediately replied and said I could take the call right now.  She called me and told me that I had gotten the position.  I felt so many waves of shock reverberate through me, I kept thinking to myself "how?" and after that phone call I went to the terms of the offer letter and accepted.  I couldn't believe it.  Still, even now after my internship has started I can't believe it.  I haven't gotten the chance to ask my mentor and manager what their thought processes were during my interview with them, but I genuinely thought that I had lost the opportunity.  But at the end of the day, I'm so, so grateful for the fact that I get to learn with Workiva and I'm so excited to make an impact on their platform and to their customers.  To mirror my previous recap, I can't way to see where this opportunity will take me.

      My final offer stats were Zurich Insurance (returning), Trane Technologies (career fair), Target Corporation (cold apply), Workiva (cold apply).  Notable interviews and non automatic OAs were GitHub, Google and Boston Scientific.
